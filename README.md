# Auto-Receipt-to-XLSX
A small GUI program that uses DocVQA from Huggingface to transcribe receipts and save them as XLSX documents for tax purposes. 
You can put all the necissary files in the images folder, it supports jpg, png, and webp. Then, to run the GUI use gui.py

# *Todo list:*
1. fix loading screen, it dosnt move and the program freezes
2. launch program in full screen, as some of the UI might now display while not fully maximized
3. test on a wider range of hardware
4. set image size to take up a certain amount of space
5. create requirments.txt

# Please note:

- If the UI does not work, make sure to maximize the program before writing a complaint, it is an issue I am going to adress.
- If the program is running slow, make sure to have Cuda and Pytorch installed in GPU compatible mode.
